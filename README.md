# Thin-Section-Manipulation

This script takes any colour image as an input, so both PPL and XPL views should work. 

A thin section of Andesite found on Google images was used as an example. 

Please note that the method I used is not perfect. I am aware that colour alone is not sufficient for mineral identification, but it can be a distinctive feature. The main purpose of this project was to find the percentage of the image occupied by the mineral selected by the user, not neccesarily to return the precise number of distinct minerals in the image.
